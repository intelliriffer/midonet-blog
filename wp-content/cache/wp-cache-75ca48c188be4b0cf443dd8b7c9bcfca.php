<p>Last week at the OpenStack Summit in Tokyo, <a href="https://github.com/openstack/kuryr" target="_blank">Kuryr</a>, the project in which we have been working hard the past few months was unveiled as the community solution to bring all the benefits from Neutron to the container networking world. OpenStack Kuryr is part of Neutron&#8217;s stadium and has seen contribution from quite a few of the companies that work on Neutron.<a href="https://blog.midonet.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/contribution_by_companies_reviews.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-535 aligncenter" src="https://blog.midonet.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/contribution_by_companies_reviews-300x207.png" alt="companies that contributed to Kuryr with reviews" width="300" height="207" /></a></p>
<p>The effort to bring Enterprise, production ready networking to the container world with Kuryr started and was enabled by the work that Docker did with refactoring its networking parts out into a pluggable external library, <a href="https://github.com/docker/libnetwork" target="_blank">libnetwork</a>. With the advent of 1.8 experimental, Docker finally opened its community favorite, easy to use workflow of working with containers for third parties to bring more value to its growing ecosystem. All thanks to the new plugging points in the storage and networking subsystems.</p>
<p>Networking wise, the new stack was made following the principle of least surprise by giving the users the already familiar Docker networking options of having no networking, sharing networking namespaces or using the good old docker0 bridged networking that we all had come to use as default. It also added two more options, overlay and remote that are taking a step into future by allowing multi host scenarios and vendor implementations respectively (vendor implementations can be single or multinode, with Kuryr providing the latter).</p>
<p>It is with Docker 1.9, that all the effort that the Docker, libnetwork and plugin developers have poured into enhancing the stack came into fruition by being released into the wild and for all the Docker users to try. Between the initial experimental 1.8 release and the 1.9 general availability there have been quite a few changes resulting from lessons learned and the communication established among the remote driver community and the Docker/libnetwork teams. While changing APIs can sometimes make the development experience a bit vertiginous, it has allowed for a rapid iteration that got us to a satisfying and sensible API.</p>
<p>Even though Kuryr will not see a formal release until the Mitaka cycle, the latest snapshots have allowed its MidoNet core developers to use it and even demo it both in <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwURaz1ic-5tVndGU1Jfb0FTQnM/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">recorded sessions</a> and live at the OpenStack Summit (yes, the demo that you can see below runs on top of MidoNet). So you can make today your deployment of MidoNet, Neutron and Keystone in a VM and try out Docker 1.9 with Kuryr for networking your machines. Not only will you be able to network the containers but you will also be able to see the container ports that Kuryr plugs both in the MidoNet and Neutron cli tools as well as in the Horizon dashboard. Currently Kuryr does not yet provide an IPAM driver since that was added to the Docker release after we &#8220;froze&#8221; development in preparation for the OpenStack Summit but it will come in shortly.</p>
