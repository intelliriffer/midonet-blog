Then you should spread all H1,H2,H3 tags in your article.Your Keyword should appear in your first paragraph and in the last sentence of the page. You should have relevant usage of Bold and italics of your keyword.There should be one internal link to a page on your blog and you should have one image with an alt tag that has your keyword....wait there\'s even more Now what if i told you there was a simple Wordpress plugin that does all the On-Page SEO, and automatically for you?
