<h4>Industry Reviews of WPSSO</h4>

<p>"<em>If you want to make every tweet, like, share, pin, and +1 count, then you should definitely start using WPSSO on your WordPress site.</em>" &mdash; <a href="http://www.indexwp.com/wordpress-social-sharing-optimization-pro-review/">indexwp.com</a></p>

<p>"<em>I’m now a customer. This plugin is invaluable and a real time saver. The fact that it won’t slow my site down either is something that also sold me on it.</em>" &mdash; <a href="http://www.wpkube.com/wpsso-plugin-review/">wpkube.com</a></p>

<p>"<em>Wherever you are at with the social media marketing strategy for your site, the WP Social Sharing Optimization plugin can help you get better results.</em>" &mdash; <a href="http://wplift.com/wordpress-social-sharing-optimization">wplift.com</a></p>

<p>"<em>If you want to get the most out of the social shares your content receives, ensure your content stands out when it is posted on the various social networks, and listed in the search engines, then this plugin is a great choice that covers all the bases.</em>" &mdash; <a href="http://www.wpmayor.com/wordpress-social-sharing-optimization-pro-plugin-review/">wpmayor.com</a></p>

<p>"<em>WPSSO Pro provides a handy tool for your marketing team, and improves your content whenever it’s shared by you or your fans.

</div>

= Social Profiles for Google Search =

WPSSO provides <a href="https://developers.google.com/structured-data/customize/social-profiles">author (Person) and publisher (Organization) social profiles</a>, <a href="https://developers.google.com/structured-data/customize/logos">publisher (Organization) logo</a>, and <a href="https://developers.google.com/structured-data/site-name">WebSite Site Name</a> in schema.org JSON-LD format for Google Search and their <em>Knowledge Graph</em>. The author (Person) markup includes the author's website URL, their profile social sharing image, and all listed contact URLs from their user profile. The publisher (Organization) markup includes the website URL, a corporate logo, a default image, and the publisher Facebook, Google+, LinkedIn, Pinterest, and Twitter business pages.

<div style="clear:both;"></div>

= User Profile Social Contacts =

WPSSO allows you to customize (Pro version) the field names, label, and add / remove the following contacts from the user profile page:

* AIM
* Facebook URL
* Google+ URL
* Instagram URL
* Jabber / Google Talk
* LinkedIn URL
* MySpace URL
* Pinterest URL
* Skype Username
* Tumblr URL
* Twitter @username
* Yahoo IM
* YouTube Channel URL

= Complete Social Meta Tags =

WPSSO adds Facebook / [Open Graph](http://ogp.me/), [Pinterest Rich Pins](http://developers.pinterest.com/rich_pins/), [Twitter Cards](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards), and [Search Engine Optimization](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization) meta tags to the head section of webpages. These meta tags are used by Google Search and all social websites to describe and display your content correctly (title, description, hashtags, images, videos, product, author profile / authorship, publisher, etc.). WPSSO uses the *existing* content of your webpages to build HTML meta tags &mdash; There's no need to manually enter / configure any additional values or settings (although many settings and options *are* available). <a href="http://wpsso.com/extend/plugins/wpsso/screenshots/">See examples from Google Search, Google+, Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, StumbleUpon, Tumblr, etc.</a> &mdash; along with screenshots of the WPSSO settings pages.

WPSSO provides the [Summary](https://dev.twitter.com/cards/types/summary), [Summary with Large Image](https://dev.twitter.com/cards/types/summary-large-image), [App](https://dev.twitter.com/cards/types/app) (requires the [WPSSO Mobile App Meta](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wpsso-am/) extension), and [Player](https://dev.twitter.com/cards/types/player) Twitter Cards &mdash; *including configurable image sizes for each card type*. The [Photo](https://dev.twitter.com/cards/types/photo), [Gallery](https://dev.twitter.com/cards/types/gallery), and [Product](https://dev.twitter.com/cards/types/product) Twitter Cards were deprecated by Twitter on July 3rd, 2015.

= 3rd Party Integration (Pro version) =

Aside from the additional support for Twitter Cards, the main difference between the WPSSO Free and Pro versions is the integration of 3rd party plugins and services.

WPSSO (Pro version) also includes support for [NextGEN Gallery versions 1 and 2](https://wordpress.org/plugins/nextgen-gallery/) albums, galleries and images (shortcodes, image tags, album / gallery preview images, etc.).

== Changelog ==

<blockquote id="changelog_top_info">
<p>New versions of the plugin are released approximately every week (more or less). 
New features are added, tested, and released incrementally, instead of grouping them together in a major version release. 
When minor bugs fixes and/or code improvements are applied, new versions are also released.
This release schedule keeps the code stable and reliable, at the cost of more frequent updates.</p>
