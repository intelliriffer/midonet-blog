<p>Last week at the OpenStack Summit in Tokyo, <a href="https://github.com/openstack/kuryr" target="_blank">Kuryr</a>, the project in which we have been working hard the past few months was unveiled as the community solution to bring all the benefits from Neutron to the container networking world. OpenStack Kuryr is part of Neutron&#8217;s stadium and has seen contribution from quite a few of the companies that work on Neutron.<a href="https://blog.midonet.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/contribution_by_companies_reviews.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-535 aligncenter" src="https://blog.midonet.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/contribution_by_companies_reviews-300x207.png" alt="companies that contributed to Kuryr with reviews" width="300" height="207" /></a></p>
<p>The effort to bring Enterprise, production ready networking to the container world with Kuryr started and was enabled by the work that Docker did with refactoring its networking parts out into a pluggable external library, <a href="https://github.com/docker/libnetwork" target="_blank">libnetwork</a>. With the advent of 1.8 experimental, Docker finally opened its community favorite, easy to use workflow of working with containers for third parties to bring more value to its growing ecosystem. All thanks to the new plugging points in the storage and networking subsystems.</p>
<p>Networking wise, the new stack was made following the principle of least surprise by giving the users the already familiar Docker networking options of having no networking, sharing networking namespaces or using the good old docker0 bridged networking that we all had come to use as default. It also added two more options, overlay and remote that are taking a step into future by allowing multi host scenarios and vendor implementations respectively (vendor implementations can be single or multinode, with Kuryr providing the latter).</p>
<p>It is with Docker 1.9, that all the effort that the Docker, libnetwork and plugin developers have poured into enhancing the stack came into fruition by being released into the wild and for all the Docker users to try. Between the initial experimental 1.8 release and the 1.9 general availability there have been quite a few changes resulting from lessons learned and the communication established among the remote driver community and the Docker/libnetwork teams. While changing APIs can sometimes make the development experience a bit vertiginous, it has allowed for a rapid iteration that got us to a satisfying and sensible API.</p>
<p>Even though Kuryr will not see a formal release until the Mitaka cycle, the latest snapshots have allowed its MidoNet core developers to use it and even demo it both in <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwURaz1ic-5tVndGU1Jfb0FTQnM/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">recorded sessions</a> and live at the OpenStack Summit (yes, the demo that you can see below runs on top of MidoNet). So you can make today your deployment of MidoNet, Neutron and Keystone in a VM and try out Docker 1.9 with Kuryr for networking your machines. Not only will you be able to network the containers but you will also be able to see the container ports that Kuryr plugs both in the MidoNet and Neutron cli tools as well as in the Horizon dashboard. Currently Kuryr does not yet provide an IPAM driver since that was added to the Docker release after we &#8220;froze&#8221; development in preparation for the OpenStack Summit but it will come in shortly.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this post, we&#8217;ll introduce the new management services included with the next version of MidoNet (5.0.0) that will be released in late September 2015.</p>
<p>Those acquainted with the <a href="http://docs.midonet.org/docs/latest/reference-architecture/content/index.html">MidoNet architecture</a> will already be familiar with the MidoNet Agent.  This daemon runs on hypervisors and gateways managing a set of datapath ports that reside physically in the same host as the daemon and are bound to virtual ports in the overlay topology.  A packet first ingressing these ports (typically from VMs) will be handed-off by the kernel to the MidoNet Agent so it can simulate the packet&#8217;s path through the overlay topology and install the adequate kernel flow to direct any further matching packets to its destination. MidoNet Agents collaborate to manage some distributed state (e.g. MAC and ARP tables in virtual devices, Routing tables, connection tracking or NAT mappings), but in practise most of the complexity involved distributed state management is delegated to well-established data stores such as Apache ZooKeeper.</p>
<p>Certain management functions aren&#8217;t bound to specific physical elements co-located with the MidoNet Agent. An example appears in our implementation of VxLAN Gateways, where we need to synchronize state among the MidoNet&#8217;s Network State DataBase (NSDB) and multiple VTEP-capable hardware switches.  Since VTEPs store state in local OpenVSwitch DataBase (<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7047">OVSDB</a>) instances, a primary task of our VxLAN Gateway controller is to synchronize several data stores.  This will hopeflly give a glimpse into the rabbit hole of constraints and complexity involved, and why it makes sense to move such control functions into a different type of node: the MidoNet Cluster.</p>
<p>Other good candidates for future Cluster services include controllers for underlay health checks or routing.  The MidoNet REST API is already implemented as a Cluster service, and we&#8217;ll soon provide ZooKeeper as an embedded service.  Both will simplify the MidoNet installation and bootstrapping experience by removing the need for users to install ZooKeeper and Tomcat as external dependencies.</p>
<p>In order to support this heterogeneity, the MidoNet Cluster includes a very thin execution framework to manage arbitrary services.  Developers are free to implement services as highly autonomous pieces of logic, which define their own strategies for redundancy, fail over, etc.</p>
<p>However heterogeneous, most services will also share basic infrastructure.  They need reliable access to the overlay configuration using the NSDB API (<a href="http://blog.midonet.org/zoom-reactive-programming-zookeeper/">ZOOM</a>), the ability to interact with other components and services, or the ability to expose its own metrics inside the JMX endpoint of its host Cluster daemon.   All this plumbing is provided by the MidoNet Cluster and available to all services with no added development effort.</p>
<p>On a MidoNet deployment, operators install the midonet-cluster package on those machines designated to run as Cluster nodes and every service included with the OSS packages will be immediately available on each of them.  The operator has the option to selectively enable or disable any of them.  As noted above, instances of the same service running on different Cluster nodes will use their own coordination strategies in order to carry out their designated tasks, so there will be minimal operational cost for operators.</p>
<p>An additional feature of the MidoNet Cluster is the possibility to write and deploy these services as add-ons.  This enables OSS contributors and proprietary organisations to develop new Cluster services and make them available in existing MidoNet deployments.</p>
<p>We will follow up with a new post demonstrating how developers can write a simple, yet fully functional MidoNet Cluster service.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We&#8217;re continuously looking for presentations on topics related to MidoNet for our <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Online-MidoNet-Meetup/" target="_blank">MidoNet Online Meetups</a>!</p>
<p>If you would like to present, please get in touch with <a href="mailto:sandro@midokura.com">Sandro Mathys</a> at your earliest convenience. Just a line or two about your (rough or early) idea is good enough to get things started, we can then work on the details and a full abstract together. Please note that we accept proposals starting immediately and that this CFP is of continuous nature, i.e. it has no due or end date. We&#8217;ll probably host only just one presentation per meetup, but we can host as many virtual meetups as we want! Therefore, we also gladly welcome several proposals by the same speaker.</p>
<p>Of course, the topic is up to you and as long as it&#8217;s related to MidoNet, it&#8217;s unlikely we&#8217;ll turn your proposal down. Also, you&#8217;re quite free to choose the length and form of your session as well as what audience you&#8217;re targeting. Different approaches might work for different people, so we&#8217;re happy to try various things and see what works best!</p>
<p>The medium will likely be Hangouts on Air, which we&#8217;d augment with a chat room to allow for questions from all viewers despite Hangouts&#8217; limit of 15 <em>active</em> participants. This way, we can have an unlimited number of watchers and still make it interactive. This will also allow for an easy transition to open discussions among all participants after the session.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re looking forward to your proposal(s)!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>by <a href="https://github.com/timfallmk">Tim Fall</a></em> <a href="https://cotap.me/timfall">tim@midokura.com</a> and <a href="mailto:toni@midokura.com">Antoni Puimedon</a></p>
<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>So we can all agree that Docker is cool. Containers are cool, repeatability is cool, portability is cool, we&#8217;re all cool. Everything is unicorns and rainbows. But something is missing in this fairy tale land, and it&#8217;s something we all like to forget about. With this wide world of other containers and services out there (&#8220;world wide web&#8221; anyone?), we want to make use of these things and connect ourselves in.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>That&#8217;s it! We forgot networking!</em></p>
<h4>Current State of Affairs</h4>
<p>Well that&#8217;s not <strong>quite</strong> fair, we didn&#8217;t <em>forget</em> it per say, we just all got caught up in building cool containers and plumb left it for later.</p>
<h5>Docker Networking</h5>
<p>Out of the box, docker gives you four networking modes that cover a lot of the container usages that have propelled docker into popularity. However, they all lack multi-host and advanced network capabilities but offer different degrees of Isolation. They are:</p>
<h6>NAT Bridge</h6>
<p>This is the default networking docker option and, in this case, the default is almost invariably the setting everybody uses.</p>
<p>It provides network namespace isolation, communication between containers in the same host and by leveraging iptables, it allows ports in the address space of the host.<br />
<img class="alignnone wp-image-429 size-full" src="https://i1.wp.com/blog.midonet.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/docker_bridged.png?resize=623%2C620" alt="depiction of NAT bridge networking that shows how veths and bridges are used to provide networking" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6>Host</h6>
<p>Under this networking setting, the containers are spawned in the same networking namespace in which the docker daemon is running. This allows the containers to see exactly the same networking as the Host.</p>
<p>It is easy to see that using this mode means that you should trust the container that runs, because it is capable of negatively impacting your networking configurations. It is important to note that if one were to build containers for doing network plumbing, <em>Host</em> networking would be really useful, as one could make an image of a daemon that has dependencies and then let it work on the base network namespace.</p>
<h6>Container</h6>
<p>It allows multiple containers to communicate with each other over the loopback device, since they share the same networking namespace.</p>
<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/blog.midonet.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/docker_container.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-430" src="https://i1.wp.com/blog.midonet.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/docker_container.png?resize=623%2C620" alt="depiction of the container based configuration, like Kubernetes pods" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>If you are familiar with Kubernetes, you will notice that when two containers share the networking namespace, the picture you get is very similar to one of the Pods in Kubernetes hosting containers.</p>
<h6>None</h6>
<p>A container with nothing in its networking namespace except the loopback device. This can prove useful when having multiple non-networking container tasks that one does not want to build a namespace and infrastructure for.</p>
<h5><code>Flannel</code> and <code>Weave</code></h5>
<p>Some overlay solutions building on top of the NAT bridge model like Flannel and Weave are starting to emerge. Flannel, for instance, will set up a /24 subnetting for each host and have them be routable with each other. The packets travel between containers in different hosts thanks to the tunneling that Flannel sets up.</p>
<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/blog.midonet.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/flannel.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-431" src="https://i2.wp.com/blog.midonet.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/flannel.png?resize=721%2C625" alt="depiction of the a typical flannel configuration" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>In order to make things more convenient, Flannel prepares a configuration file for the docker daemon that is picked up by the docker daemon at start up and will communicate to docker which address space the docker Linux Bridge has and make it to be used to put the veths when launching containers.</p>
<p>This was a big step as it finally allowed for cross-host communication in an effective and simple way. While this will cover many cross-host use cases in Dev &amp; Test, solutions leveraging Open vSwitch will be insufficient for production deployment because they suffering from design limitations inherent in the technology.</p>
<h4><code>libnetwork</code> (&#8220;*vendor training not required&#8221;)</h4>
<p><a href="https://blog.docker.com/2015/04/docker-networking-takes-a-step-in-the-right-direction-2/"><code>libnetwork</code></a> is a new project from Docker designed to bring full-fledged networking to containers and make them a first class citizen. With the <a href="https://blog.docker.com/2015/03/socketplane-excited-to-be-joining-docker-to-collaborate-with-networking-ecosystem/">aquisition of SocketPlane.io</a>, an experienced team of networking experts at Docker has been hard at work making networking a reality.</p>
<p><code>libnetwork</code>&#8216;s integration to Docker, which will come in the coming weeks, is backwards compatible and, at the same time, adds new actions to the docker api/cli like <code>docker network create</code>. Then, when running a container, it will be possible to specify which network should be used.</p>
<p>With the emergence of libnetwork, vendors no longer have to rely on wrapping the docker API/cli like <code>weave</code> and others do. The <code>libnetwork</code> project is designed to create a framework, that will live alongside other core frameworks in Docker (<code>libcontainer</code>,Compose, Machine, Registry, and Kinematic) and provide support for networking options. This will primarily take the form of a set of APIs against which people can create container-based options for a range of networking solutions. <code>libnetwork</code> will ensure much better integration, simpler deployment and more responsiveness in network performance. You can check out more about how <code>libnetwork</code> works <a href="https://blog.docker.com/2015/04/docker-networking-takes-a-step-in-the-right-direction-2/">on the blog post</a> and on the <a href="https://github.com/docker/libnetwork">repository</a>.</p>
<h4>MidoNet and the <code>libnetwork</code> Future</h4>
<h5>MidoNet</h5>
<p>MidoNet is an open source, distributed network virtualization software. The MidoNet project has already been integrated with a number of different open source projects, including OpenStack and OPNFV. Therefore, it seemed like a natural fit to be the first member to leverage <code>libnetwork</code>.</p>
<p>MidoNet uses an agent to manage connections between containers (intra and inter-host) and creates point to point tunnels for passage of traffic. The network topology and all systems data are stored in a clustered database system, built on open source technology like Cassandra and Zookeeper, which are directly accessible via a number of API endpoints.</p>
<p><img src="http://i0.wp.com/blog.midonet.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Logical-Topology-With-Background.png" alt="Layout of overlay networks in MidoNet" /></p>
<p>For more detailed information on MidoNet see <a href="http://midonet.org">midonet.org</a> and <a href="midonet.github.com">midonet.github.com</a>.</p>
<h4>Container Networking</h4>
<h5>Prior to libnetwork</h5>
<p>Before the introduction of <code>libnetwork</code> MidoNet relied on the <code>docker event</code> interface to gather state information about running containers and to watch for new events. This approach worked, but did not provide the truly native support of a first-class citizen network.</p>
<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/blog.midonet.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/event_midonet_poc.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-432" src="https://i1.wp.com/blog.midonet.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/event_midonet_poc.png?resize=694%2C300" alt="the evented design shows how the actions originate in dockerd and midockerd reacts to those" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lightweight. No need for complex listeners or loops</li>
<li>Simple. Uses the same tools and cli as normal <code>docker</code></li>
<li>Functional. Enabled complex networking without touching <code>docker</code> core</li>
</ul>
<p>Cons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reactionary event driven mechanism</li>
<li>One way street. No native mechanism for container awareness of network conditions</li>
<li>Additional tooling. Complex network changes required the use of the <code>midonet</code> cli to edit the network directly</li>
</ul>
<h5>With libnetwork</h5>
<p><code>libnetwork</code> allows for a mechanism driver to provide networking functions that core <code>docker</code> functions are aware of. A &#8220;plugin&#8221; framework allows for direct support of networking between containers and across hosts including functions like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tunneling</li>
<li>Load balancing</li>
<li>Cross host networking</li>
<li>And many more</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p>There is also work being done on supporting cross-engine networking.</p></blockquote>
<p>MidoNet will leverage this new model to support feature-rich and highly scalable fast networking. Rather than relying on “wrapping” a new set of tools around the existing Docker API and cli, MidoNet will now use <code>libnetwork</code> to provide a network “driver” service that advertises functions directly into the other Docker components. This will expand the networking capabilities of Docker, while also substantially simplifying interaction with networking drivers.</p>
<h3>Get Started</h3>
<p>The current working version of MidoNet with <code>docker</code> is part of a broader project to make MidoNet compatible with Docker, Swarm, Kubernetes, Mesosphere, and other distributed systems. You can find the project and instructions for how to run it on the project&#8217;s repository.</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="https://github.com/midonet/bees">MidoNet Bees: MidoNet for Swarm, Kubernetes, and Mesosphere</a></p></blockquote>
<h4>Contribute!</h4>
